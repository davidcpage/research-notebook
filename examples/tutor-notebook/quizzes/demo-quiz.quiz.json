      "hint": "It's known as the City of Light.",
      "explanation": "Paris is the capital and largest city of France, located on the Seine River."

      "question": "What is the value of $\\pi$ to two decimal places?",
      "answer": 3.14,
      "tolerance": 0.01,
      "hint": "It's the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.",
      "explanation": "Pi (π) ≈ 3.14159... The value 3.14 is the standard two-decimal approximation."

      "question": "Explain in one sentence why the sky appears blue.",
      "hint": "Think about how light interacts with Earth's atmosphere.",
      "explanation": "Rayleigh scattering causes shorter blue wavelengths to scatter more than longer wavelengths."

      "explanation": "Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 8\nStep 2: Divide both sides by 2: x = 4"

The short blue wavelengths of sunlight scatter more than longer red wavelengths when hitting air molecules.

Divide both sides by 2: **x = 4**\n\nIt looks like you may have subtracted 3 instead of 5, or made an arithmetic slip. Try plugging x=5 back in: 2(5) + 5 = 15 ≠ 13. But x=4: 2(4) + 5 = 13 ✓",
